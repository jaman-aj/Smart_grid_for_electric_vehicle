# Machine Learning-Based Smart Grid System for Estimating Energy Requirements of Electric Vehicles in Various Locations

The model has been build using the RandomForestRegressor algorithm from the Scikit-learn library. The model is designed to estimate the amount of energy required for a trip in an electric vehicle based on various parameters such as distance, consumption per km, energy deviation, average speed, and road condition. The data used to train the model was collected from the "https://www.spritmonitor.de/en/" website for the Volkswagen e-Golf vehicle using Beautiful Soup.

The model is specifically designed for electric vehicles that are connected to a smart grid system. The smart grid system enables the electric vehicle to communicate with the power grid and receive information about the availability and cost of electricity. This information is then used by the model to estimate the energy required for a trip based on the location of the vehicle and the availability and cost of electricity in that location.

The RandomForestRegressor algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used for regression tasks. It works by building multiple decision trees and combining their outputs to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The data used to train the model includes information about the energy consumption of the vehicle, such as the distance traveled, consumption per km, energy deviation, average speed, and road condition.

The Machine Learning-Based Smart Grid System for Estimating Energy Requirements of Electric Vehicles in Various Locations can be used to estimate the amount of energy required for a trip in an electric vehicle connected to a smart grid system. The model can help electric vehicle owners optimize their energy consumption by providing information about the most efficient routes to take and the optimal times to charge the vehicle.
